                  <h2>Origins of Golf</h2>
                  <p>Golf originated from a game played on the eastern coast of Scotland, in an area close to the royal capital of Edinburgh. Players would attempt to hit a pebble over sand dunes and around tracks using a bent stick or club. During the 15th century, Scotland prepared to defend itself against an invasion by the ‘Auld Enemy’. The nation’s enthusiastic pursuit of golf however, led many to neglect their military training, so much so that the Scottish parliament of King James II banned the sport in 1457. Although people largely ignored the ban, it was only in 1502 that the game gained the royal seal of approval when King James IV of Scotland (1473 -1513) became the world’s first golfing monarch.
                    The first reference to golf at its now recognized historic home town of St Andrews in 1552. It was not until 1754 however that the St Andrews Society of Golfers was formed to compete in its own annual competition using Leith’s rules.
                    The first ever 18-hole course was constructed at St Andrews in 1764, establishing the now recognized standard for the game. <br></br>For more information, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_golf" target="_blank"><u><i> here.</i></u></a></p>

                      <h2>Golf Etiquette</h2>
                      <p>--> Golf etiquette exist to not only show respect, but also to promote safety and awareness. To maintain the quality of our game play, it is very important for all of us to follow the rules. Here are some of the most essential ones to keep in mind: </p><br></br>
                      <ol>

                        <li> Never walk in someone's line of play on the putting green.</li>
                        <li> Repair the ground you played on (fixing ball marks and divots). </li>
                        <li> Do NOT talk or stay in other's field of vision when they are about to swing. </li>
                        <li> T-shirts, jeans, sandals, or other improper attires are not allowed.</li>
                        <li> Keep your temper under control no matter how bad you play (do not be like Glenn Quagmire!!).<br></br>
                      </ol>

                  <h2>Golf Scoring</h2>
                  <p>The scoring system in golf is different than that of most sports, where the higher score is the winner. In golf, success is determined by the lower score, or the fewest number of shots taken on the hole or in the round. Each course has a designated number, known as par, that represents the score a skillful golfer would shoot. Furthermore, each hole on a course, typically 9 holes or 18 holes, has its own par score (typically 3, 4, or 5). A course's par score is the sum of the par scores for each of the holes.</p><br></br>
                  <h4>Terms to know:</h4>
                  <p>Par: A par score is attained when a golfer completes a hole in the number of strokes listed on the course scorecard (see below first picture). For example, a par-4 hole requires a golfer to finish the hole in four shots to attain par. </p><br></br>
                  <p>Birdie: A birdie is a score 1 stroke less than par. Birdies can be achieved on any hole. For example, shooting 4 strokes on a par-5 hole.</p><br></br>
                  <p>Eagle: An eagle is a score 2 strokes less than par.<p><br></br>
                  <p>Bogey: A bogey is the term used to express 1 stroke over par.</p><br></br>
                  <p>Double-bogey: A double-bogey is a score 2 strokes over par.</p><br></br>
                  <p>Hole-in-one: A hole-in-one occurs when a golfer holes the ball on the tee shot. The hole-in-one happens most often on par-3 holes.</p><br></br>
                  <p>Out-of-bounds: A ball is out-of-bounds when all of it is outside the boundary edge of the course. You get a 1-shot penalty for hitting your ball out-of-bounds (that means a +1 stroke on the hole).</p><br></br>
                  <p>Water Hazard: Water hazards are natural obstacles designed to add both beauty and difficulty to a golf course. Water hazards are typically either streams or ponds, situated between the teeing ground and the hole. A ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty. If it cannot be played from the hazard, the ball may be hit from another location, generally with a penalty of one stroke.</p><br></br>
